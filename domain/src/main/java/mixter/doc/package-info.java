/**
 * This package contains live documentation annotations. They describe the important parts of mixter to try and help
 * the developer get a feel for the concepts he or she is manipulating through the exercises. We annotated elements from
 * DDD, CQRS and ES.
 *
 * The definitions in the annotations are the ones we chose. While some are commonly agreed upon, other can be subject
 * to different interpretations. We are not pretending that we know better and encourage you to explore the concepts and
 * build your own opinion on the matter. We try to provide some links to help you begin your exploration. We hope you
 * will have as much fun as we do in the process !
